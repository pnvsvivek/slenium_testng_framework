# slenium_testng_framework
This repository contains selenium &amp; testng framework that testing projects can use for Automation.
This project is mainly based on the creation & running of dynamic XML from the TestCriterion 'Y' in Excel sheet which maintains data required for the AUT.
All this is happening in Runner class and only thing we are doing is selection of test cases to run and run the Runner class and create a report where it uses extent reports which is the best for logging and atatching screen prints in report itself
And if there are any errors in execution they will be noted down in a text file that is available in error_Report folder.We can create a batch file from the Runner which is very simple
InorderInorder to view HTML content that is available in Status_report, place the path of HTML page link in this http://htmlpreview.github.io/
